The instructions were:
  WRITE IT AGAIN SUCH THAT IT ACHIEVES
  99.4% validation accuracy
  Less than 20k Parameters
  You can use anything from above you want.
  Less than 20 Epochs
  No fully connected layer

My code does the task in 17,224 total parameters and achieves 99.4% accuracy on the 19th epoch.
I did not use a fully connected layer. You can look in the code to see the model architecture and training logs.
